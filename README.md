# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using Python. The objective is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content. The project includes data collection from Twitter, preprocessing of the text data, and the application of machine learning models to predict sentiment.

Features:
1. Data Collection:
Uses the Twitter API (or Tweepy) to collect real-time tweets based on keywords or hashtags.
Alternatively, a CSV file with pre-collected tweets can be used.
2. Text Preprocessing:
Cleaning and tokenizing the tweets (removing stop words, handling emojis, URLs, mentions, etc.).
Converts text to lowercase and removes special characters.
3. Feature Engineering:
Converts text into numerical format using techniques like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings.
4. Modeling:
Uses machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or more advanced models such as LSTM or BERT for classification.
5. Evaluation:
Evaluates the performance of models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices.
6. Visualization:
Visualizes results using bar charts and word clouds to show sentiment distributions and frequently used words.
